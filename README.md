# MATH3-Project-In-Progress
This version of MATH is a work in progress version so feel free to test it. To run it type "git clone https://github.com/Clo612/MATH3-Project-In-Progress.git" (Without quotations) in your Linux terminal. Then type "cd MATH3-Project-In-Progress" (Without quotations) in your Linux terminal. Then type "chmod +x math3(the math type).sh" (Without quotations) in your Linux terminal. Then you type "./math3(the math type).sh" (Without quotations) in your Linux terminal. Finally Do Some math. Running code in multiple programming languages typically involves having the necessary interpreters, compilers, or runtime environments installed on your system. Here's a general guide on how you can run code in different languages on Linux:

Bash:

No installation required, as Bash is the default shell on most Linux systems.
Save your Bash script with a .sh extension.
Make the script executable: chmod +x script.sh
Run the script: ./script.sh

C/C++:
Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): sudo apt-get install gcc g++ (for Debian-based systems).
Save your C/C++ code with a .c or .cpp extension.
Compile: gcc source.c -o executable or g++ source.cpp -o executable
Run: ./executable

Python:
Python is usually pre-installed on Linux.
Save your Python script with a .py extension.
Run: python script.py or python3 script.py (for Python 3).

Java:
Install OpenJDK or Oracle JDK: sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk (for Debian-based systems).
Save your Java code with a .java extension.
Compile: javac MyProgram.java
Run: java MyProgram

Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript):
Install Node.js: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your JavaScript/TypeScript code with a .js or .ts extension.
Run: node script.js or ts-node script.ts (if using TypeScript).

Go:
Install Go: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Go code with a .go extension.
Compile and run: go run script.go or build and run the executable: go build script.go && ./script

Ruby:
Install Ruby: sudo apt-get install ruby (for Debian-based systems).
Save your Ruby script with a .rb extension.
Run: ruby script.rb
Swift:

Follow the instructions on the official Swift for TensorFlow GitHub repository.
Save your Swift code with a .swift extension.
Compile and run: swiftc script.swift && ./script
Rust:

Install Rust: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Rust code with a .rs extension.
Compile and run: rustc script.rs && ./script

Perl:
Perl is often pre-installed on Linux.
Save your Perl script with a .pl extension.
Run: perl script.pl

PHP:
Install PHP: sudo apt-get install php (for Debian-based systems).
Save your PHP script with a .php extension.
Run: php script.php

Haskell:
Install GHC: sudo apt-get install ghc (for Debian-based systems).
Save your Haskell code with a .hs extension.
Compile: ghc -o script script.hs
Run: ./script

Scala:
Install Scala: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Scala code with a .scala extension.
Compile and run: scalac script.scala && scala script
Lua:
Install Lua: sudo apt-get install lua5.3 (for Debian-based systems).
Save your Lua script with a .lua extension.
Run: lua5.3 script.lua

Elixir:
Install Elixir: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Elixir script with a .ex extension.
Run: elixir script.exs

Julia:
Install Julia: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Julia script with a .jl extension.
Run: julia script.jl

Kotlin:
Install Kotlin: Follow the instructions on the official website.
Save your Kotlin code with a .kt extension.
Compile: kotlinc script.kt -include-runtime -d script.jar
Run: java -jar script.jar

Groovy:
Install Groovy: sudo apt-get install groovy (for Debian-based systems).
Save your Groovy script with a .groovy extension.
Run: groovy script.groovy
You can adapt these steps based on your Linux distribution and the specifics of each programming language's setup and execution. Keep in mind that these instructions are general and may require adjustments based on your system's configuration.
